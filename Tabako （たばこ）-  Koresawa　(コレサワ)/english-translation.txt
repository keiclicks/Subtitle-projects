24 hours have passed since you left last night
I still haven’t even taken one step outside

I think about you, and the way you’d often sleep in
because you were so easygoing
There’s no point in the clock at my house being 5 minutes ahead anymore

I guess you smoked out on the veranda
Out of concern for me, because I hate cigarettes
The curtains swayed, and my eyes got hot
You’re not there anymore

“Make sure, make sure you look at me more”
Did those words weigh heavy on you?
“Make sure, make sure you look at me more”
Would you have stayed if I hadn’t said that?

You probably know me well
I get warm when I wanna go to sleep
And I like short kisses better

How well
Did I know you?
The first thing that came to mind
Was the name of your favorite cigarettes

“I should, I should look at you more”
I’m realizing that now, all too late
“I should, I should look at you more”
What’s the point of even realizing that now?

You left your cigarettes here
I hate them with a passion
So why’d I light them?

They smelled like you, like you
I took one drag
But of course, it made me choke up

“Make sure, make sure you look at me more”
Would you still be here if I hadn’t said that?
“Make sure, make sure you look at me more”
The slightly bitter way you smelled made me cry
